# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

PixelArt converts keyboard emojis into pixel art, publishes them to a public live feed, and archives them with creator credit and timestamp. This Policy explains what we collect, how we use, share, and protect data.

## Data We Collect

1) Account Information  
Email, display name/avatar (if provided), registration and sign‑in records.

2) Works and Metadata  
Generated emoji pixel art, creator credit (your account identity), timestamp, and provenance fields (e.g., platform/region/code where available).

3) Usage & Device  
Page views, generation actions, credit deductions, device/browser, IP, country/region, cookies or similar technologies.

4) Orders & Payments  
Order id, amount, purchased credits/plans. Card data is processed by third‑party providers; we do not store full card numbers.

5) Communications  
Emails, tickets, feedback you submit.

## How We Use Data

- Provide & maintain the service: account, sign‑in, generation, feed ranking, credit accounting and risk control.  
- Public display & archive: show works in the Emoji Live Feed with creator/timestamp; index and preserve in the global keyboard‑emoji archive.  
- Security & compliance: logging, anomaly detection, abuse prevention, legal requests.  
- Analytics & improvement: product iteration, performance and reliability.  
- Communications: service notices, billing, policy updates as permitted by law.

## Public Display Scope

Works are public by default in the feed. We display the pixel art, creator credit (account identity), and timestamp. These may be preserved long‑term for archival purposes.

## Credits, Free Quota and Counters

To implement lifetime 3 generations per account (email‑unique) and 30‑day credit expiration, we process per‑account counters and credit status for risk‑control and accounting purposes.

## Sharing and Disclosure

- Service providers: payment processors, CDN, logging/security/analytics, strictly limited to what is necessary.  
- Legal: to comply with law or respond to lawful requests.  
- We do not sell personal information.

## Cookies & Similar Tech

We use necessary cookies (sign‑in/security) and analytics cookies (usage stats). We also use Microsoft Clarity to understand how you use our site and improve your experience. Clarity may record session replays, heatmaps, and user interactions. You can manage cookies in your browser.

## Retention and Deletion

- Accounts & orders: retained as required by law.  
- Works & metadata: preserved long‑term for archival purposes. If you delete your account, works are generally anonymized rather than deleted, unless otherwise required by law or removed upon valid rights complaints.

## Your Rights

Access, correct, download your account data; delete your account; withdraw consent (may affect service). For rights complaints or takedown, contact us via email below.

## Children

The service is not intended for users under 16. If we learn a child under 16 used the service, we may restrict or delete the account and related data upon verification.

## International Transfers & Security

Data may be processed outside your region. We adopt encryption, access control, and least‑privilege, but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes

We may update this Policy; material changes will be notified on‑site or by email, with an effective date posted here.
