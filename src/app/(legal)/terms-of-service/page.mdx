# Terms of Service

## Introduction and Acceptance

PixelArt is an online service that converts keyboard emojis into pixel art, displays them publicly in a live feed, and archives them as part of a global keyboard‑emoji archive. By accessing or using the service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please stop using the service.

## Accounts and Sign‑in

- You must register and sign in to generate. The author credit uses your account identity (email‑unique).
- You are responsible for your account information and all activities under it. No sharing, lending, transfer, or impersonation.

## Service Description and Public Display

- Each generation produces an emoji pixel art that will: (i) be publicly shown at the top of the Emoji Live Feed, (ii) include creator credit and timestamp, and (iii) be archived with searchable provenance.
- Hiding/deleting of publicly shown works is currently unavailable. We may remove, anonymize, or restrict content for legal, safety, or rights‑complaint reasons.

## Pricing, Credits and Free Quota

- Generations consume credits. Credits expire 30 calendar days after being granted/credited. Purchases are non‑refundable to the extent permitted by law. Failed charges confer no entitlement.
- Prices may change as posted on the site. You agree to pay charges associated with your plan or purchases.
- Lifetime free quota: each account (email‑unique) has 3 free generations in total. We may perform risk checks to prevent abuse.

## Works, Ownership and Licenses

- We do not claim copyright in the generated pixel art (to the extent applicable by law). We grant you a global, transferable, sublicensable, royalty‑free, perpetual license to use the generated pixel art for personal and commercial purposes.
- You grant PixelArt a global, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to publicly display, archive, promote, research, and reasonably reuse the generated works (including off‑site display for product demos and showcases).
- You warrant your inputs/uses do not infringe third‑party rights. You are responsible for your inputs/outputs and their use.

## Acceptable Use

No illegal content, harassment/hate, exploitation, spam/gaming the feed, credential sharing, scraping without authorization, reverse engineering, security circumvention, or attacks. We may limit, suspend, or terminate accounts for violations.

## Third‑party Services and Payments

Payments are processed by third‑party providers; full payment card data is not stored by us. We may use CDN, logging, security, or analytics services as necessary.

## Disclaimers
